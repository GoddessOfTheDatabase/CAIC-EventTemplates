For Adding CAIC Events, Organizers & Venues that don't already exist.  
DO NOT overwrite the files! 
Step 1: Download which .csv file you need (probably only EVENTS),
Step 2: Open the downloaded .csv file, and SAVE AS (yourname)_Events.csv
Step 3: Add your Event data
Step 4: Save the changes to YOUR FILE
Step 5: Email YOUR FILE as an attachment to ME crafteecook@Hotmail.com.  This will change in the future...Thanks
